Trias Introduction

An all-platform-supported native-application-compatible smart contract execution platform, development framework and collaborating ecosystem.

TRIAS aims to create a new-generation public chain, which will support the execution of general-purpose native-applications on all platforms. The vision is to root trust in machines by creating the Trustworthy and Reliable Intelligent Autonomous Systems.

TRIAS Includes Three Subsystems：

Leviatom: a Global Trusted Computing Platform. Leviatom combines Heterogeneous TEE technologies and Graph algorithms to implement an efficient, robust, highly-extensible consensus algorithm, and further supports the trustworthy execution of native applications.

Prometh: a Traceable-Software Development Framework. Prometh combines formal verification and DevSecOps framework to achieve traceable and verifiable general-purpose application development, implementing smart-contract-level trustworthy assurance for native applications.

MagCarta: an All-platform Smart Contract and Token Ecosystem. MagCarta contract achieves the uniform scheduling of general-purpose traceable applications on global trusted computing platforms. It further employs both incentive and insurance mechanisms to drive the community with rewards and compensations.
